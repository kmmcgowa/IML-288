# IML-288
These are the files for the final project of IML 288 Critical Thinking and Prodedural Media.

The sketch runs in [processing](http://www.processing.org) with the control board operating off an arduino board.

The sketch can run in processing 3.0 without the use of the board. Create a Data folder and drop in any audio file, change path in main.pde to new audio file and play.
